  Task: Create three tracking links - use tight digit-check rules. Stick to basic steps, no extras; go by test examples exactly.
  Instructions:
  Set up fresh endpoints using tight checks. Go for clear results - no assumptions here. Works on lists, whether dozens or thousands, runs at a solid speed.
  Requirements (as tested):
  - GET /adv/percentile
  Query: nums, p
  - nums: a list of whole numbers split by commas, no spaces, no fractions or breaks.
  p: any figure between zero and one hundred, never less, never more.
  Behavior:
  Look at the numbered options. Pick a spot using this method: grab p, times it by n, split by 100, then push it up to next whole number - unless it’s already one. Still, don’t let it drop below 1 or jump past n. If p is zero, pick number one straight away.
  Choose the number you land on as you count up from one.
  - Here's the deal: take nums = 1,2,3,4; now if p = 75, you do rank = ceil(0.75 × 4), that comes out to 3 - so result is 3.
  - Wrong info added → triggers error 400.

  - GET /adv/convolve
  Query: a, b
  a b.
  Behavior:
  - Work on every math part separately – don't loop or skip ahead
  c[k] comes from multiplying a[i] with b[k−i], adding those values where i fits, as k runs from 0 up to len(a) combined with len(b), minus one.
  - Here's the deal: if a is 1,2,3 but b stands at 4,5 → c becomes [4,13,22,15].
  - Wrong ask → HTTP 400.

  - GET /adv/mmm
  Query: nums
  - nums: a list of whole numbers separated by commas, no spaces or decimals (must have at least one digit).
  Behavior:
  {"mean": m, "median": d, "mode": o}.
  mean is all stuff added up, then shared equally among each part. median? line up every number from low to high - take the middle one straight out.
  The mode’s the number that shows up most - tests are made so there's no tie.
  - Wrong info sent → so you see error 400.

  Validation helpers:
  Use whole numbers - no spaces, no decimals, nothing missing. No empty lists either.
  - Give reusable checkers a go - they handle URL number lists better.

  Stuff you might have to tweak:
  - server/middleware/validate.js
  - server/routes/advanced.js
  - server/services/calculator.js

  Notes:
  - Use simple methods to finish fast - sorting takes O(n log n) time for percentiles; chats run in O(nm).
  Shoot back a 400 if the input’s wrong - tests won’t care what words you use. But make sure the status stays right, whatever happens.

  Anti-cheating guidance:
  - Make sure your code works fine even when stuff changes - inputs aren't stuck on one example; tests swap them out.
  Keep things basic. Skip tricks that depend on timing or fixed answers.
