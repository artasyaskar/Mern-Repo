task_description: |
  Complex number tasks requiring precise integers along with strong performance targets.
  Instructions:
  Install new top-tier access points with strong safeguards. Even though speed matters, balance the results well.
  Requirements (as tested):
  - GET /adv/powmod
  {"result": a^b % m} where a, b, m are integers, b ≥ 0, m > 1.
  Reject wrong numbers or broken ranges with error 400 instead.
  - Quick math: handles huge numbers - say, b close to 10 million - without slowing down, using a trick called squaring over and over.

  - GET /adv/modinv
  {"result": x} where x is a number between 0 and m−1, such that when you multiply a by x and divide by m, the remainder is 1 - given that a and m are integers, and m greater than 1.
  If there’s no inverse - meaning gcd(a,m) ≠ 1 - return HTTP 400 along with an error note.

  - GET /adv/crt
  {"x": found_value, "m": lcm_result}.
  If nothing fits since the remains clash, return HTTP 400.

  - GET /adv/primes_segment
  L, R are integers where 2 ≤ L ≤ R. Pick output format - json or csv - it’s your call.
  {"result": [prime numbers from L up to R]}.
  prime numbers like 2 then 3 also 5 next 7 besides 11 plus 13 along with 17 followed by 19 including 23 ending at 29.
  - Pace: R must hit 100k quicker than 1.5 seconds if running with json config.

  - GET /adv/stats
  - Give numbers, split by commas. Not there or got weird stuff? Send back HTTP 400.
  {"mean": m, "variance": v, "stddev": s} with variance calculated via n−1; return raw values.

  - GET /adv/gcd_array
  - Give numbers, split by commas. If none given or wrong type → send back HTTP 400.
  {result: biggest number that divides all positive versions}.

  Validation helpers:
  - Choose an integer-only validator - like requireIntegers - for fields that need full numbers instead of fractions or decimals.
  - Go through each thing on the list – confirm it's actually a digit, not empty or words.

  Example documents that might need to fix:
  - server/middleware/validate.js
  - server/routes/advanced.js
  - server/services/calculator.js

  Anti-cheating guidance:
  Don't tie replies to specific numbers - tests run on random values or faster checks. Go loose, so shifts don’t crash the system. Every test could drop fresh input or tighter time needs. Rolling with change beats rigid outputs every time.
  - Stick to simple tricks: fast power tweaks, extended Euclid for inverses or merging leftovers, broken-down sieve for ranges, tracking repeated shapes.
