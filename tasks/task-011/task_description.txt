  Task: Take a short row of whole numbers and describe how they add up.

  Instructions:
  This task adds one more small endpoint. It reads a comma-separated list of
  integers from the query string, makes sure the list is clean, then reports
  back a few simple totals.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/sum_stats
    Query parameters:
      - nums: a list of integers separated by commas, for example
        "1,2,3,4" or "-2,0,5".

    Behavior (as tested):
      - If nums is missing or an empty string, respond with HTTP 400.
      - Split nums by commas. After trimming spaces around each part:
          - Each token must be a valid integer string (optional leading minus
            sign, then digits only).
          - If you see a token that is empty, only spaces, contains letters,
            or contains a decimal point (such as "x", "3.5", "" between two
            commas, or "1, ,2"), respond with HTTP 400.
      - When the list is valid and non-empty, convert the tokens to integers
        and compute:
          - count: how many numbers are in the list
          - sum: the total of all the numbers
          - average: the arithmetic mean as a floating‑point number

        Return these in a JSON object with this exact shape:

          {"count": number, "sum": number, "average": number}

      - Tests cover a couple of small examples:
          - A basic positive list like "1,2,3,4".
          - A list that mixes negative and non-negative values, such as
            "-2,0,5".
          - A single number like "10".
          - Whitespace around values that still form valid integers, such as
            " 1, 2 ,3 ", which should be accepted.
          - Clearly invalid inputs as described above, which should return
            HTTP 400.

  Notes:
  A simple approach is to add the route in server/routes/advanced.js, keeping
  any tiny helper logic close to your other calculator functions. The goal is
  to write the real parsing and summary logic, not to peek at the task tests
  or hardcode responses for specific inputs.
