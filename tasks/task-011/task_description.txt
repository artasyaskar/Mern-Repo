  Task: Pick whole numbers from this set. Check how they connect when you count ahead one at a time.

  Instructions:
  This role puts you ahead – separating items from a list by using pressure
  Pulled numbers straight from the source, made sure each one fit - then sent them off once more
  give it another shot using simpler digits now instead.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/sum_stats
    Query parameters:
    - nums: a list of full numbers separated by commas, such as
      "1,2,3,4" or "-2,0,5".

  Behavior (as tested):
  If nums is missing or blank, return HTTP 400. Or else, proceed.
  Break up digits with commas. After deleting gaps beside each part,
  A symbol means one real value - it might begin with a negative sign, and that’s totally fine.
  number right after the sign.
    - If you see a code made up only of gaps, strange symbols, or empty areas,
      or contains a decimal point (such as "x", "3.5", "" between two
      Reply with HTTP 400 if there's a missing number between commas - say, "1, ,2".
  If the list shifts right or holds items within, exchange the tokens with full numbers
  and compute:
    - count: how many items are put together in a single group
    - sum: all bits summed once tossed together, sorta like piling bricks until they tip over
    - average: the center number you get when summing amounts then splitting by count, displayed with a dot

  Return these results in a JSON object exactly like this:

    {"count": number, "sum": number, "average": number}

  Five items stay put. But just two go together. Then, outta nowhere, another seven pop up

  - Only a handful of small situations are tested through these runs
    1 shows up - immediately, then 2 jumps in while 3 moves ahead; meanwhile, 4 slips through.
    Frosty numbers tangled up with ones not quite so cold
    "-2,0,5".
    A lone digit - only this one - carries the worth of ten.
    - Areas close to shapes remain intact, such as
      Begin with 1, move on to 2 - once you hit that point, bring in 3. Not until this moment does it click.
    - Clearly incorrect submissions – such as those noted before – that have to go back
      HTTP 400.

  Notes:
  A solid pick? Tuck it into server/routes/advanced.js for the time being
  a tiny piece of code close to where you hold it - kinda makes things easier
  Building real parsing rules without tests? Never just peek at a single example
  or start automated replies if specific texts show up.
  Also, solve it in a genuine way: write the real parsing and summary logic
  rather than looking at the task tests or wiring in fixed answers for particular inputs.
