  Task: Summarize a small list of integers with simple center and spread metrics

  Instructions:
  Create a fresh endpoint that reads a short list of whole numbers from the query
  string, validates them, then returns a few basic statistics. Follow the test
  examples exactly; you only need to support the concrete cases used in tests.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/center_range
    Query parameters:
      - nums: comma-separated integers, e.g. "1,2,3,4" or "-5,0,5"

    Behavior (as tested):
      - Parse nums into a non-empty list of integers. If nums is missing, empty,
        or contains any token that is not a valid integer (e.g. "x", "3.5",
        extra commas, or stray spaces that donot form a valid number), respond
        with HTTP 400.

      - For valid input, compute:
          - min: smallest value in the list (integer)
          - max: largest value in the list (integer)
          - mean: arithmetic average as a floating-point number
          - range: max - min

        The response JSON shape is:
          {"min": number, "max": number, "mean": number, "range": number}

      - Tests only use small lists of integers, including negative values and
        single-element lists. You do not need to optimize for very large inputs.

  Notes:
  - Keep the implementation straightforward and deterministic; no randomness or
    timing tricks.
  - A natural place for the core logic is in server/services/calculator.js, with
    routing and basic query parsing in server/routes/advanced.js. If you prefer,
    you may also reuse helpers from server/utils/array.js.
  - Validation can be done inline in the route or via a small helper; tests only
    check the behaviors described above.
