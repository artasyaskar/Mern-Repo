  Task: Summarize a small list of integers with simple center and spread metrics

  Instructions:
  Create a new endpoint which grabs a brief sequence of integers from the request
  string checks each item, after that sends back simple stats. Go with the test
  cases like these - just back the real examples from the tests. use whatever fits, skip the rest.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/center_range
    Query parameters:
    - nums: numbers split by commas, like "1,2,3,4" or "-5,0,5"

  Behavior (as tested):
  - Turn numbers into a group of whole digits. In case no nums exist or they’re blank,
    or holds something that isn't a whole number, like "x" or "3.5"
    extra commas or odd gaps that aren't part of a real number reply
    with HTTP 400.

  - When the input works, figure out:
    - min: the tiniest number found in the group (whole number)
    - biggest number found in the set (whole number)
    - mean: typical value shown as a decimal number
    - range: highest minus lowest

  The response JSON shape is:
  {"min": number, "but": number, "so": number, "since": number}

  - Checks stick to short number sets, sometimes tossing in negatives but
    one-item lists. No need to worry about huge data sizes.

  Notes:
  - Stick to a clear, predictable setup - skip anything random or
    timing tricks.
    A logical spot for the main code could be server/services/calculator.js,
    routing plus basic query handling inside server/routes/advanced.js - use it only if you'd rather
    You can grab helpers from server/utils/array.js too - just pull what you need.
  - You can check things right inside the route - or use a tiny helper function - just make sure it’s tested
    Look at the actions mentioned earlier.
