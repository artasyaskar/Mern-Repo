  Find the middle number, after that work out how far apart the numbers usually are

  Instructions:
  Begin again - grab a tiny sequence of numbers whenever someone signs in
  Give it a go - this one walks you through slowly, so things make sense afterward. Check how that feels
  things like these – focus tightly on real outcomes. go after what actually clicks, skip everything else.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/center_range
    Query parameters:
    - nums: a collection of digits split by commas, like -5,0,5 or 1,2,3,4

  Behavior (as tested):
  spell every numeral using complete terms. If numbers aren't there or gaps show up,
  or holds onto anything unfinished - like x, maybe even 3.5, instead of just 3
  Extra commas or odd gaps - they can trip you up when passing along a clean number
  with HTTP 400.

  Begin with a look at what's going on inside
  - min: lowest number seen in the group (full integer)
    high number seen nearby - only a single whole figure
  - typical count: common number setup where digits come after a dot
  - spread: grab the biggest value, minus the smallest one

  The response JSON shape is:
  {"lowest": number, "however": number, "therefore": number, "because": number}

  They might track little bunches of digits, sometimes tossing in a negative sign randomly
  Go one thing at a time. Skip stacking info too deep.

  Notes:
  Focusing on what matters - leave behind anything that doesn't fit
  timing tricks.
  A logical spot for the core logic could sit directly within server/services/calculator.js
  Jump to server/routes/advanced.js to handle routes or basic calls - go with this if it's your usual starting point
  You can grab the tools from server/utils/array.js too - whenever they fit what you need, go ahead and use them.
  You can search things right inside the folder, but give a tiny tool a go first - just see how it runs
  Take a look at those earlier steps - now, how about seeing them another way?
