  Task: Summarize a small list of integers with simple center and spread metrics

  Instructions:
  Start a fresh endpoint that pulls a short string of numbers when someone calls in
  Try it out - it goes through every piece step by step, then shows clear numbers. See how it works
  stuff like this - zero in on actual results. aim for what works, leave out the rest.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/center_range
    Query parameters:
    - nums: a list of numbers separated by commas, such as -5,0,5 or 1,2,3,4

  Behavior (as tested):
  Write out numbers as full words. In spots where digits are absent or spaces appear,
  or keeps a value that’s not a full number - say, x instead of 4, or perhaps 3.5 rather than sticking to 3
  extra commas, weird spaces - these don’t belong in a proper number response
  with HTTP 400.

  - As it begins, check out what’s happening within:
  - min: smallest value found in the set (full number)
  top count spotted among the team - just one full digit
  - usual number: standard digit display with values following a decimal point
  - range: highest outcome less the lowest

  The response JSON shape is:
  {"min": number, "however": number, "therefore": number, "because": number}

  - They’ll follow small groups of numbers, sometimes slipping in negatives here or there
  Take it step by step. Avoid loads of details piling up.

  Notes:
  - Focus on core stuff - leave out surprises
  timing tricks.
  A natural choice for the core script might go right inside server/services/calculator.js
  head over to server/routes/advanced.js for routing plus simple queries - pick this one if you usually start here
  You can take the tools from server/utils/array.js either – if it suits your needs, just do it.
  You can look up stuff directly in the path, but try a small helper function - just double-check how it works
  Check out the steps listed before.
