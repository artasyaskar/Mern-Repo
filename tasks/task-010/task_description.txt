  Task: Read a short list of integers from the query string and report a few
  simple summary numbers.

  This task adds one small endpoint: it accepts a comma-separated list of
  integers, checks that the list is well-formed, then returns the minimum,
  maximum, average value, and the range.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/center_range
    Query parameters:
      - nums: comma-separated integers, for example "1,2,3,4" or "-5,0,5".

    Behavior (as tested):
      - If nums is missing or an empty string, respond with HTTP 400.
      - Split nums by commas. After trimming spaces around each piece:
          - Every token must be a valid integer string (optional leading minus
            sign, then digits only).
          - If you see a token that is empty, only spaces, contains letters,
            or contains a decimal point (such as "x", "3.5", "" between two
            commas, or "1, ,2"), respond with HTTP 400.
      - When the list is valid and non-empty, convert the tokens to integers
        and compute:
          - min: the smallest integer in the list
          - max: the largest integer in the list
          - mean: the arithmetic mean as a floating-point number
          - range: max - min

        Return these in a JSON object with this exact shape:

          {"min": number, "max": number, "mean": number, "range": number}

      - Tests cover a few simple cases:
          - A basic positive list like "1,2,3,4".
          - A list with negative values like "-5,0,5".
          - A single-element list like "42".
          - Whitespace around numbers that still form valid integers, such as
            " 1, 2 ,3 ", which should be accepted.
          - Clearly invalid inputs as described above, which should return
            HTTP 400.

  Notes:
  - A straightforward approach is to add the route in server/routes/advanced.js
    and keep any small helper logic alongside the other calculator utilities.
  - You do not need to optimize for large inputs; the tests only use short
    lists.
