  Task: Pick a few digits from the sheet - after that, explain where they come from
  simple summary numbers.

  This role adds a small change: it grabs comma-split items either this way or that - short yet clear, skipping repeats or anything stiff
  figures, checks if stuff matches, then returns the lowest
  top value right away, mid level comes clear meanwhile shifting across numbers.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/center_range
    Query parameters:
    - nums: a list of numbers separated by commas, such as "1,2,3,4" or "-5,0,5".

  Behavior (as tested):
  If nums is missing or empty, return HTTP 400.
  - Split digits into chunks with commas. After taking out blank spots around each set:
    Every token must be a full number written in words - might start with a negative sign. One at a time, each should stand clear on its own. Leave out any that have periods or lines through them. Just plain old integers, from small to big, no tricks
    mark - then digits only.
  - If you see a token that’s empty, filled with gaps, or packed with strange signs,
    or contains a decimal point (such as "x", "3.5", "" between two
    put commas like "1, ,2", so return HTTP 400.
  If the list’s still got stuff in it, change each token to a number by flipping
  and compute:
    the smallest value spotted within that set
    max: the highest full number spotted when checking that set
    - average: total split by how many items, given as a number with decimals
    - range: top value minus bottom one

  {"error": "No input provided to rewrite."}

  {"min": number, "max": number, "mean": number, "range": number}

  - Looks after only a few simple cases
    1 arrives first, soon after 2 pops in. Next thing you know, 3 turns up - right behind it, 4 tags along.
    -5, then a zero pops up - right behind it, 5 steps in.
    A lone clothing item, like "42".
  - Areas close to numbers behaving just like whole figures, say
    Start with one, then two comes next, while three follows - this is how progress happens.
  - Incorrect details from earlier, which should go back
    HTTP 400.

  Notes:
  A hassle-free method? Try placing it inside server/routes/advanced.js
  Keep small tools by your math gear.
  You don’t need to manage loads of data - tests use small chunks now. Instead of huge stacks, quick mini-pulses work faster. Little slices fit right into the rhythm naturally. Brief inputs keep progress smooth without snags
  lists.
