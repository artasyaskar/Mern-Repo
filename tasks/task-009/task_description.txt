  Task: Sliding window statistics over integer streams
  Instructions:
  Add a new endpoint that computes rolling statistics over a list of integers using a fixed-size sliding window, with strict validation rules. Focus on correctness and clear behavior; follow the examples below.
  Requirements (as tested):
  - GET /adv/rolling_stats
    Query: nums, k, ddof (optional)
    - nums: comma-separated list of integers (no spaces, no decimals). At least k integers are required.
    - k: window size, positive integer >= 2 and <= len(nums).
    - ddof: optional integer, defaults to 1. Must satisfy 0 <= ddof < k.

    Behavior:
    - Validate inputs. Return HTTP 400 when:
      - nums is missing, empty, contains non-integer tokens, or has fewer than k elements.
      - k is missing, not an integer, < 2, or > len(nums).
      - ddof is provided but is not an integer or violates 0 <= ddof < k.
    - Let the windows be all contiguous subarrays of length k from nums.
      For each window, compute sample statistics using denominator (k - ddof):
        - mean: arithmetic mean (float allowed)
        - variance: sample variance
        - stddev: square root of variance
    - Response JSON:
      {
        "means":   [m_0, m_1, ...],
        "variances": [v_0, v_1, ...],
        "stddevs": [s_0, s_1, ...]
      }
      where each index corresponds to one sliding window in order.

  Notes:
  - Focus changes in:
    - server/routes/advanced.js
    - server/services/calculator.js
    - server/middleware/validate.js (optional but allowed for shared validation helpers)
  - Use straightforward algorithms (no hard-coding for specific test values). Complexity O(n * k) or better is fine for these constraints.
