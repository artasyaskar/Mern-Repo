  Task: See digits shift as pieces of info swap out

  Instructions:
  Create a new gadget - this thing finds moving averages by working through number groups in a sequence
  Work out how big the window is. Choose precise answers by breaking it down slowly.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/rolling_stats
    Query parameters:
    - nums:
      description: >
        A list of full numbers split by commas - like 1,2,3,4,5.
        Trials done with tiny sets - like 1, then 2, followed by 3, or maybe 4 before 5.
    - k:
      description: >
        The window size stands for a whole number. Yet during tests, folks often pick smaller values - like 3.

  Try it out with sample info - see what happens
  - Return HTTP 400 if:
    - nums is empty while k is given (e.g. nums="", k=2).
    - k's less than 2 - like when nums is "1,2,3" but k equals 1.
    - k's bigger than how many numbers are in nums - like if nums is "1,2" but k equals 3.

  Figuring stuff out – shaped through test attempts
  Tackle every k-digit piece in nums like it's a single moment.
  Work out the price for every window
  - mean: arithmetic average
    varying how it divides - applies k minus one down below instead of the whole figure
  - stddev: found by taking the square root of variance
  - Like this: say nums="1,2,3,4,5" while k=3, then groups are [1,2,3], after that [2,3,4], then [3,4,5]
    yield stays around [2.0, 3.0, 4.0], meanwhile variance sticks near 1.0.
  - The response JSON structure is:
    {
      m0, then again m1, along with a bit extra
      v0 with v1, along some others like them
      [s0, s1, ...]
    }

  Notes:
  - Mostly peek at server/routes/advanced.js – also glance over server/services/calculator.js while you're there
  - Go with a simple O(nk) method; fancier options exist, yet they’re not needed
    required by tests.
