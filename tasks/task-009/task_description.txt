  Task: Follow numbers within moving chunks of data

  Instructions:
    Add a fresh endpoint that calculates rolling statistics from number lists using a set
    window size. Aim for accurate results with straightforward logic.

  Requirements (as tested):

    - GET /adv/rolling_stats
      Query parameters:
        - nums:
            description: >
              A sequence of whole numbers separated by commas (e.g. "1,2,3,4,5").
              Tests use small integer lists such as "1,2,3,4,5".
        - k:
            description: >
              The window size (an integer). Tests use small k values such as k=3.

  Validation checks (as tested):
    - Return HTTP 400 if:
      - nums is empty while k is given (e.g. nums="", k=2).
      - k is smaller than 2 (e.g. nums="1,2,3", k=1).
      - k is larger than the number of values in nums (e.g. nums="1,2", k=3).

  Computation rules (as tested):
    - Treat each contiguous group of k numbers in nums as a window.
    - For each window, calculate:
      - mean: arithmetic average
      - variance: sample variance with denominator (k - 1)
      - stddev: square root of variance
    - For example, with nums="1,2,3,4,5" and k=3 the windows [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5]
      yield means [2.0, 3.0, 4.0] and variances/stddevs equal to 1.0.
    - The response JSON structure is:
      {
        "means": [m0, m1, ...],
        "variances": [v0, v1, ...],
        "stddevs": [s0, s1, ...]
      }

  Notes:
    - Mainly look at server/routes/advanced.js but also check server/services/calculator.js
    - Stick to a clear O(nk) implementation; more optimized approaches are welcome but not
      required by tests.
