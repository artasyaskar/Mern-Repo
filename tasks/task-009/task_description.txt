  Task: Watch numbers change when bits of data switch places

  Instructions:
  Create a fresh tool - this one tracks trends by crunching digits step by step through a line of values
  Figure out the size of the window. Pick accurate options by going step by step.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/rolling_stats
    Query parameters:
    - nums:
      description: >
        A sequence of whole digits separated using commas - such as 3,7,2,9,4.
        Trials used small groups - just one at first, after that two, next up three, perhaps four ahead of five.
    - k:
      description: >
        The window size means a full number. But when testing, people usually go for tinier options - say, 3.

  Give it a go using example details - find out how it works
  - Return HTTP 400 if:
    - nums is empty while k is given (e.g. nums="", k=2).
    - k smaller than 2 – say nums is "1,2,3", yet k’s just 0.
    - k is larger than the count of numbers in nums - say nums has 1,2 but k is 3.

  Finding answers by trying things out - built from trial runs
  Tackle each k-digit chunk in nums as if it’s one instant - using different words every time, switching up how things sound, keeping it short, tossing out fluff, making sure no line drags on.
  Work out the price for every window
  - mean: arithmetic average
    varying its split method – uses k minus one underneath rather than the full number
  - stddev: calculated by getting the square root of variance
  - For example: if nums equals "1,2,3,4,5" and k is 3, you get chunks like [1,2,3], next comes [2,3,4], followed by [3,4,5]
    yield holds steady at about [2.0, 3.0, 4.0], while variance remains close to 1.0.
  - The response JSON structure is an object with three array fields:
    {
      "means": [m0, m1, ...],
      "variances": [v0, v1, ...],
      "stddevs": [s0, s1, ...]
    }

  Notes:
  - Mainly check out server/routes/advanced.js – while you’re at it, take a quick look at server/services/calculator.js
  - Stick to an easy O(nk) approach; fancier ones are out there, but you won't need 'em
