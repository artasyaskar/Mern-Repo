  Task: Keep track of digits inside shifting blocks of info 

  Instructions:
  Create a new feature - this one works out moving averages from number groups inside a collection
  window dimensions. Go for precise answers using clear thinking.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/rolling_stats
    Query parameters:
    - nums:
      description: >
        A list of full numbers with commas between them (like "1,2,3,4,5").
        Checks work with tiny number sets like "1,2,3,4,5".
    - k:
      description: >
        The window size is a whole number. For tests, folks often pick tiny numbers - like 3 instead.

  Verification steps (based on testing):
  - Return HTTP 400 if:
    - nums is empty while k is given (e.g. nums="", k=2).
    - k's less than 2, like when nums is "1,2,3" and k equals 1.
    - k's bigger than how many numbers are in nums - like if nums is "1,2" and k equals 3.

  Calculation methods (based on tests):
  Tackle every stretch of k digits in nums like it's a single frame.
  - Work out the value per window:
    - mean: arithmetic average
      varying how it's split - uses k minus one down below instead of total count
    - stddev: found by taking the square root of variance
  - Like this: if nums="1,2,3,4,5" while k=3 then groups are [1,2,3], also [2,3,4], plus [3,4,5]
    yield stands at [2.0, 3.0, 4.0], meanwhile variances or stddevs sit around 1.0.
  - The response JSON structure is:
    {
      m0, m1, along with others
      v0, v1, along with others like them
      [s0, s1, ...]
    }

  Notes:
  - Focus mostly on server/routes/advanced.js - also peek into server/services/calculator.js
  - Go with a straightforward O(nk) method; better versions are fine, yet not needed
    required by tests.
