  Task: Implement robust quantile computation service
  Instructions:
  Create a new endpoint that figures out quantiles in two ways - while running strict validations.
  Requirements (as tested):
  - POST /adv/quantiles
    Body: {
      numbers: a set of digits - needs at least two entries
      method": a string that’s either "tuque" or "linear" - optional, picks "tukey" if blank
      percentiles: a choice of full numbers between 0 and 100 – picks [25, 50, 75] by default
    }
    Behavior:
    - Go over the info slowly. Ditch it if:
      if there’s no figure provided, it’s not counted as a list - contains something non-numeric, or just lacks enough entries
    - "technique" doesn't fit the list of what's accepted
    - "percentiles" covers values outside [0, 100] or entries that aren’t integers
    Arrange digits starting from the tiniest up to the biggest prior to using them.
    - method="tukey":
      Apply Tukey’s method - split data, then find medians at each half.
      If N is odd, skip the middle digit when splitting both parts.
      If N is even, split it right in half - then locate the two middle values.
    - method="linear":
      Move across all positions by following a direct blend - include every dot. Use a line that connects them without gaps or jumps.
      At position p (0 to 100), the index is roughly i = (p/100)(N−1), found between nearby elements.
      Move up from floor(i) to ceil(i), shifting gradually through each level.
    {"25": 2, "50": 3, "75": 4}.

  Notes:
  - Simply adjust: server/routes/advanced.js, while updating server/services/calculator.js, then touch server/middleware/validate.js
  Keep things moving smoothly when dealing with large amounts - results hold strong, no hiccups or lagging behind.
