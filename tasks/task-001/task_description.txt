  Task: 
  Instructions:
  Set up complex number-based functions, then tweak them for accurate results using exact math
  Instructions:
  Requirements (as tested):
  - POST /adv/stats
    Body: { 'numbers': list of number values, 'ddof' optional whole number } - if missing, ddof is 1
    Check it’s a non-blank list of real numbers. If n minus ddof is zero or less, shoot back 400
    {"mean": 5.3, "median": 5, "mode": 4, "variance": 2.1, "stddev": 1.4}
    - Work with sample stats using denominator (n minus ddof)
    - Manage numbers safely, even as high as 1 billion

  - GET /adv/primes
    - Input: n (whole number), maybe a starting point (number at least 2), choice of layout – either json or csv
    - Give prime numbers from [start, n] when start is given; otherwise, list them from [2, n]
    {"result": [1, 2, 3]}
    "prime" 2 3 5 7 11
    - Check numbers: use whole numbers only; send back 400 when start is bigger than n
    - Speed test: n equals twenty thousand using json format should finish under two seconds

  - GET /adv/gcd and GET /adv/lcm
    - Inputs should be whole numbers (send back 400 if they're not)
    - Answers can't be negative (like gcd(-8,12)=4; lcm(-4,6)=12)

  Notes:
  - Change just: server/routes/advanced.js, also server/services/calculator.js, alongside server/middleware/validate.js
