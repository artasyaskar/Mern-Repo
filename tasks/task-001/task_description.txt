  Task: Build connections using complex numbers - after that, adjust each one 
  Instructions:
  Work with functions using complex numbers - tweak accuracy through thoughtful math steps
  Instructions:
  Requirements (as tested):
  - POST /adv/stats
    Body: { 'numbers': certain numeric entries, whereas 'ddof' might show up as an integer } - if missing, defaults to 1
    1. Check that every spot in the list has a real number, nothing blank. If n minus ddof drops to zero or less, send back 400.
    {about 5.3 on average, but the center’s actually 5; 4 pops up most often, range stretches to roughly 2.1, whereas usual gap from mean sits near 1.4}
    Try different figures - split them by n minus ddof
    Deal with huge numbers safely - say close to a billion, maybe even slightly above

  - GET /adv/primes
    You hand me: n (just a whole number), maybe where to begin (anything from 2 onward), then choose the format - json or csv
    Show prime numbers from [start, n] when start's given - else show them from [2, n]
    {"result": [1, 2, 3]}
    top yet 4 3 6 8 10 anyway
    Check numbers: use whole digits only; send back 400 if total goes past n
    - See how fast it is: once n hits twenty thousand using json info, wraps up in less than two seconds

  - GET /adv/gcd and GET /adv/lcm
    - Need whole numbers only – send back 400 if off; test every number ahead of replying
    No bad results here - grab gcd(-8,12), that gives 4; when one's minus, lcm(-4,6) still hits 12

  Notes:
  - Switch just: server/routes/advanced.js, when tweaking server/services/calculator.js - remember to update server/middleware/validate.js
