  Task: Implement and adjust advanced numeric endpoints
  Instructions:
  Set up functions using complex numbers - then tweak accuracy through tight computations
  Instructions:
  Requirements (as tested):
  - POST /adv/stats
    Body: { 'numbers': a set of numeric entries, though 'ddof' may show up as an integer } - if missing, defaults to 1
    1. Check that the list has real numbers, not blanks. 2. If n less ddof equals zero or below, give back 400.
    {"average": 5.3, though the center point's actually 5; you'll see 4 pop up most often, how stretched it is comes out at 2.1, whereas usual gap from mean ends near 1.4}
    Try different values - split them by n minus ddof
    Deal with huge numbers safely - say, close to a billion, maybe even a bit more

  - GET /adv/primes
    - You hand me: n (just a whole number), maybe a starting point (anything from 2 onward), also choose the format - json or csv
    Show prime numbers between [start, n] when start’s given; otherwise list them from [2, n]
    {"result": [1, 2, 3]}
    "top" but 4 3 6 8 10 yet
    - Check numbers: use whole digits only; send back 400 if start goes past n
    - Test how fast it runs: if n hits twenty thousand using json info, wraps up faster than two seconds

  - GET /adv/gcd and GET /adv/lcm
    - Inputs gotta be whole numbers - toss back 400 if anything’s off, but test every value upfront before replying
    No negative results accepted - like how gcd(-8,12) gives 4; lcm(-4,6) still comes out 12

  Notes:
  - Switch just: server/routes/advanced.js, when upgrading server/services/calculator.js - also tweak server/middleware/validate.js
