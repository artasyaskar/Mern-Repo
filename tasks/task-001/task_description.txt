  Task: 
  Instructions:
  Set up tricky number spots so every action works right. Fix each part till checks are green.

  Requirements (as tested):
  - POST /adv/stats
  - Body: { "numbers": list of numbers, "ddof" optional integer }
  - Check: list isn't empty and holds only real numbers; when n minus ddof is zero or less → return 400 (ddof usually is 1).
  {"mean": "average value", "median": "middle number when sorted", "mode": "most frequent number", "variance": "how spread out numbers are", "stddev": "square root of variance"}.
  Variance or stddev? They go with sample stats, using n minus ddof down below. Each time it's set up a bit different - keeps things moving without fluff or repeats.
  Numeric stability deals with values near 1e9 - using safeguards to prevent overflow or errors during calculations.

  - GET /adv/primes
  - Input: n (number), maybe start (numb >= 2), format choice like json or csv.
  - if start given: give back prime numbers from [start, n]; otherwise just list them from [2, n].
  {"result":[1,2,3]}.
  "prime" 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 .
  - Check input: use whole numbers only. If start is bigger than n, return 400.
  - Speed test: with n=20000 and json output, finishes under 2 seconds.

  - GET /adv/gcd and GET /adv/lcm
  - Input needs whole numbers only - toss out fractions or decimals (like 400).
  - Results stay positive (like gcd(-8,12)=4; lcm(-4,6)=12).

  Notes:
  - Tweak just: server/routes/advanced.js, also server/services/calculator.js, along with server/middleware/validate.js
