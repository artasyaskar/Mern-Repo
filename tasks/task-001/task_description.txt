  Task:Build or adjust tricky numeric connections
  Instructions:
  Shift uneven sections till each step feels right. Adjust all parts while feedback improves.

  Requirements (as tested):
  - POST /adv/stats
  - Body: { 'numbers': a list of number values, plus possibly "ddoo f", which might be a whole number }
  - Check: make sure the list isn't empty, every entry’s a real number; when n minus ddof drops at or below zero → return 400 (ddof usually means 1).
  {"mean": "average value", "median": "middle number when sorted", "mode": "most frequent number", "variance": "how spread out numbers are", "stddev": "square root of variance"}.
  Variance or standard deviation? Pick sample stats - split by n minus ddof down below. Each config adjusts a bit; stays fluid, no junk, no repeats.
  Numeric stability manages values near 1e9 - preventing breakdowns during wild calculations through smart safeguards. When things get shaky, adjustments happen instantly so results stay correct.

  - GET /adv/primes
  - Give me a number n, start from any value - just make sure it's 2 at least - then decide your format, like json instead of csv.
  - if you get a starting number: give back prime numbers between that start and n; otherwise list the ones from 2 up to n.
  {"result":[1,2,3]}.
  prime numbers: 2, later 3, right after 5, soon comes 7, not far behind is 11, just before 13, close by 17, nearby 19, moving on to 23, finally stops at 29.
  Check the input - use whole numbers only. If start is bigger than n, return 400 instead.
  - Speed test: once n reaches 20,000 with output as json, finishes under two seconds.

  - GET /adv/gcd and GET /adv/lcm
  Just stick to full numbers - skip anything with bits or pieces (like 400).
  - Responses stay upbeat, much like how gcd(-8,12) results in 4; whereas lcm(-4,6) becomes 12.

  Notes:
  - Tweak just server/routes/advanced.js, yet sneak into server/services/calculator.js, then brush against server/middleware/validate.js
