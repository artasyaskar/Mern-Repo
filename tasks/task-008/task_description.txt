task_description: |
  Task: Set up three checkpoints - each verifies inputs, returning results if needed - or skips otherwise - but only when conditions match - no extra steps - just basic validation - at every stage - one after another - not all at once - each works alone - never together 
  Got HTTP 400 when data’s off.

  Instructions:
  Start or refresh endpoints to handle basic checks - when tested, include those cases
  simple math tasks. Go for clear, hands-on reasoning.

  Requirements (as tested):

  1. GET /adv/prime_factors
     Query: n
     Behavior (as tested):
     - Tests hit this endpoint using bad inputs - say, n=1 or some random text instead of numbers,
       expect HTTP 400.
     - None check exact prime factors; just confirm these don't pass
       inputs return 400.

  2. GET /adv/rolling_median
     Query: nums, k
     Behavior (as tested):
     - Checks use obviously wrong data, yet still anticipate a 400 error response in such situations
     - List is 1,2,3 with k set to 2 - an even number
     - nums="", k=1 (empty nums)
       No checks confirm specific median outcomes actually worked.

  3. GET /adv/unique_mode
     Query: nums
     Behavior (as tested):
     - When a digit shows up more times than others in a basic sequence such as "1,2,2,3",
       the endpoint oughta give back {"result": 2} plus a HTTP 200 code.
       If two numbers appear same times - like 2,2,3,3 - the
       endpoint oughta give back HTTP 400.
       A single input like nums="42" triggers HTTP 200 plus delivers {"result": 42}.
     - A wrong list format like nums="1,2,3.5" should give back HTTP 400; more general
       Checks don't confirm validation.

  Stuff you might have to tweak:
  - server/middleware/validate.js
  - server/routes/advanced.js
  - server/services/calculator.js

  Notes on tests:
  - Checks run on just a few preset cases per endpoint.
  - Work on clearing up the logic so it makes sense for examples like these.
