  Task: Grab some small numbers from the row. Then give them back flipped around.

  Instructions:
  This feature brings in a tiny extra option. Besides that, it pulls comma-separated entries
  numbers from the web address, makes sure everything’s right before sending back
  flipped these digits the opposite direction.

  Requirements (as tested):

  - GET /adv/reverse_list
    Query parameters:
    - nums: a collection of whole figures split by commas, like
      "1,2,3,4" or "-2,0,5".

  Behavior (as tested):
  If nums isn't there or empty, send back HTTP 400. Otherwise skip it.
  Use commas to separate numbers. Remove empty spaces near every section
    - Every sign should mean an actual number, maybe starting with a negative
      mark followed by numbers alone.
    - When you spot a code that's void, totally blank, or filled with odd characters,
      or contains a decimal point (such as "x", "3.5", "" between two
      if you spot commas like "1, ,2", send back HTTP 400.
  - If the list is running yet keeps items, switch the bits into whole numbers
    flip 'em over once more.

  {"reversed": [integers]}

  - Checks pass through several basic scenarios:
    1 – coming right after 2 – then there's 3 – finally 4.
    - A collection including negatives mixed with positives, like
      "-2,0,5".
    A lone digit - just seven.
    - Spots near numbers that stay whole, like
      1, 2 – next up 3 – that’s how you finish it.
    - Wrong info from before, that needs to be sent back
      HTTP 400.

  Notes:
  A basic choice? How about putting the path into server/routes/advanced.js instead - using a different spot could help
  a small tool near your existing math gear - aim is
  to create actual parsing while doing opposite steps - miss testing examples prior to beginning
  or pick ready-made replies if you get certain questions.
