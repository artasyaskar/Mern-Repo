Project: MERN Training Base Repo

Overview:
This is a minimal MERN-style starter project designed to host 10 independent tasks for LLM training.
- Backend: Node.js + Express (server/)
- Frontend: Static HTML (client/) served by Express
- Tests: Jest (tests/base and per-task tests under tasks/<task-id>/)

Grading Workflow Compatibility:
- Dockerfile uses node:20-alpine; ENTRYPOINT runs ./run_tests.sh
- docker-compose.yaml passes TASK_ID and mounts the repo to /app
- run_tests.sh accepts an optional [task-id] and runs base tests or task-specific tests

Structure:
- server/: Express app, routes, and utils
- client/: Static frontend placeholder
- tests/base/: Base test suite to verify environment
- tasks/: Placeholder for task directories (each with task_description.txt, task_tests.js, task_diff.txt, run-tests.sh, docker-compose.yaml)

How to run locally:
- npm test
- npm start (to run the server)
- docker compose build && docker compose run --rm app ./run_tests.sh BASE
